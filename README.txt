Description: The following program is a shell created using C. The shell has the following fearures...

    1. Provide a prompt for running commands
    2. Handle blank lines and comments, which are lines beginning with the # character
    3. Provide expansion for the variable $$
    4. Execute 3 commands exit, cd, and status via code built into the shell
    5. Execute other commands by creating new processes using a function from the exec family of functions
    6. Support input and output redirection
    7. Support running commands in foreground and background processes
    8. Implement custom handlers for 2 signals, SIGINT and SIGTSTP


Compile the program as follows:
    Launch terminal
    cd into directory containing main.c file.
    Run command in terminal: gcc --std=gnu99 -o smallsh main.c
    Run command in terminal: ./smallsh

Example.

$ smallsh
: ls
junk   smallsh    smallsh.c
: ls > junk
: status
exit value 0
: cat junk
junk
smallsh
smallsh.c
: wc < junk > junk2
: wc < junk
       3       3      23
: test -f badfile
: status
exit value 1
: wc < badfile
cannot open badfile for input
: status
exit value 1
: badfile
badfile: no such file or directory
